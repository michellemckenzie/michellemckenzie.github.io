                <p>Hello! Welcome to my mathtastic game!</p>

                <p>When playing this game, I'd like for you to get at least one question wrong, earn 10 points, and click the help button for a refresher on the rules once.</p>

                <p> Here are some questions to answer after playing: 
                    (1) Does the timer provide sufficient amount of time to answer and why? (2) Is it obvious to the user when players change turns and how do you know? (3) What can be added or taken away to make this experience more engaging or easier to understand?
                </p>

                <p> There are two players. A player will be randomly selected to begin the game. Players will take turns answering math questions.</p>

                <p> If a user gets a question right, they'll earn one point. You can submit answers by clicking the button 'submit' or hit the enter key. There is a timer for 9 seconds, so be quick! If you get a question wrong, or the timer runs out, the other player gets to play. 
                If you need a break from questions, click the 'skip' button to skip your turn, and the other player will be up. The first player to reach the goal points is the winner!
                </p>
