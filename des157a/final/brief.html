        <h1>Final Project Brief</h1>
        <p>The project I would like to update is studio 3 - Game On by incorporating animations, more audio files, and changing the game that is played.</p>

    <div class = "compare">
        <p id = "c1"> One website that shares similar qualities that I would like to implement is Apple's website for the iPhone 13. The interface relies on scrolling, and media will move up with animations setting the content in place. This is what I would like to implement to avoid having to click a button, and the screen suddenly changes. By incorporating animations, the game will feel more lively and engaging. Apple does a good job with the contrast between text and images, making everything readable and easy to see. However, some parts of Apple's website can use touchups. For example, when I was scrolling I found that I sometimes scrolled too fast and missed some information due to the animations speeding up to match my fast scrolling, or when I scrolled too slowly the animations were jittery.

    <div class = 'compare'>
        <p id = "c2">Another project that implements touches that I would like to use is Rappi pay. It's a website advertising a credit/debit card and utilizes animations to bring content into view instead of having the content in place already. The animations are eye catching and makes the user want to continue scrolling to perhaps see more of the animations out of curiousity, thus leading them to read the website. Something that this website does well is that after a user has scrolled and the animations bring the content out, when you scroll back and go down again, the animations don't replay so the user can read the previous information easily. Something that could be changed is the rate at which the slideshow changes. When it first loads it immediately swipes to the next screen making it difficult to read. </p>

    <div class = "compare">
        <p id = "goals"><u>Project Goals</u> - My project will be similar to these two websites in the way that I would like to use animation to display my content. Information will slowly come into place as opposed to popping up. The difference between my project and these websites would be that I would not implement scrolling. I would use buttons to progress to the next stage. This is due to the fact that I do not have content that exceeds more than the max height/width, so using a button to trigger animations seems smoother than scrolling when there is not much to show. Moreover, I would like to include audio for user feedback which these websites do not have.</p>
        <p id = "design"><u>Design Strategies</u> - Overall I would like the interface to be minimalistic. This includes using simplified abstractions of images such as using a numberline instead of a die. In addition to looking minimalistic, I would also like the interface to be clean and simple. Using one shape such as circles keeps the geometry to a minimum. Color is another factor I want to limit. I want the majority of the website to be white, but not full of negative space. I'll incorporate box shadows to distinguish white cards from the white background. I'd like to challenge myself to use the least amount of images, shapes, and colors but still create an effective design that user's can enjoy and understand.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "compare">
        <p id = "interaction"><u>Interaction Strategies </u>- I would like to implement a time based interaction for when the user has not made a move in awhile. This would include making the help button start to "glow" or have an arrow pointing to it. Once the user makes a move, those animations will stop. Including an audio file to play when this happens can increase grabbing the user's attention. Moreover, I would like the user to be the one that rolls the die, instead of the computer automatically rolling the first roll. This is to make the game more engaging for the user instead of sitting there and watching the computer play it out for them. When a player switches turns, I want to make it obvious when that occurs by placing a "sticker" on the player's card which then "peels" off once they start to play. Their name is still underlined to show that it is still their turn though.</p>
        <p id = "experience"><u>Experience Goals</u> My goal for the user experience is to be fun, and challenging. But not challenging in the way that the user will get frustrated. I want to create a game that requires more thinking beyond pressing roll or skip. I'd like for the user to rely on their memory or thinking skills to make their decisions. Moreover, I want the user to feel as though they understand what the game is doing every step of the way by communicating to the user what is happening, why, and what is happening next. An example of such communication is when the user has to slow down and take their time counting numbers to make sure the game did the math correctly, when the computer can display the results explicitly.</p>
