                <p>Hello! Welcome to my mathtastic game!</p>

                <p> There are two players. A player will be randomly selected to begin the game. Players will take turns answering math questions.</p>

                <p> If a user gets a question right, they'll earn one point. You can submit answers by clicking the button 'submit' or hit the enter key. There is a timer for 15 seconds, so be quick! If you get a question wrong, or the timer runs out, the other player gets to play. Every question you get wrong is a strike! 3 strikes and you lose all of your points.</p>
                <p>If you want to pass your turn, click the 'pass' button to skip your turn, and the other player will be up. The first player to reach the goal points is the winner!</p>
