                <h3>Game On!</h3>

                <p>Mobile games are rampant throughout the App Store. What sets a game apart from others can sometimes boil down to the design and usability over the content, because no matter how good a storyline is, if it is frustrating to use, people won't reccommend it or continue playing it. So what makes a good game?</p>

                <p>User’s tend to hold their phones with their thumb resting more towards the bottom portion of their device. Thus, this opens up a range of mobility that the thumb can reach. Data has shown that it is easier to access buttons closer to the bottom of the screen, and buttons more towards the top are more difficult to access. In addition to interacting with buttons, when we use popups to offer the user more information, displaying a big “X” to close the page has users subconsciously finding the popup irrelevant and wanting to close it quickly. Instead, we can utilize other button options such as “done” or “continue”. My personal preference is that the X for a popup is redundant. Many popups offer clicking on the dimmed background to close it, and should be standard practice. Moreover, trying to click on an X requires more precision than clicking the background. </p>

                <p>Along the lines of buttons, user options should be on the righthand side of a closing button. A reason for this may be due to most people being right handed, so if you want users to interact with your website and avoid closing something on accident, it’s best that their choice is closer to where their hand or mouse will be. <br><br> Inspired by <a href = "https://uxplanet.org/game-design-ux-best-practices-guide-4a3078c32099"> <i>Game Design UX Best Practices</i></a></p>

                <h3> Visual Thinking pt. 2</h3>

                <p> I took this image during the summer of 2021 up at Pope Beach, Lake Tahoe. My friend Alicia, had her family from Michigan fly out here which was special because she doesn't get to see them very often. Alicia had just gone swimming in the cold, crystal water. She has an adventurous soul and doesn't mind the coolness of the water. In the image, she was finally getting some time to rest after waking up in the dark morning to go parasailing for the first time. <br><br><br>This image is part of my polaroid collection that I like to take on trips or special occasions. I like the "one shot at it" that comes with instant film. Even "messing" up a shot looks good on film. Capturing a moment without the subject knowing they're being photographed makes the photo seem more real, and authentic. This image is just an example of how I like to take photo of even the small things. </p>

                <p> I'm reviewing Vladimir's image which is a photoshoot of him on his motorcycle, with the main focus on the bike. An interesting aspect of this image is the color coordination between the bike and the rider. There is a clear distinction between the use of red and black. Another interesting thing to notice is the complex design of the motorcycle, which gives it character. </p>

                <p> We can obviously see that Vladimir is sitting on his bike. Something to think about is why did he choose to leave his face out of the image? Why is the side of the bike photographed as opposed to the front, back, or a different angle?</p>

                <h3> Visual Thinking </h3>
                
                <p> Social media has in a way warped how we may perceive images. They should be perfect, flawless, cute, and everything in between. But those imperfect photos that reflect the reality of our lives invite and invoke thought provoking analysis. When the photo does more talking than the caption, it leads to a range of creativity. </p>

                <p> An example of an image that engages the user, is Vincent Van Gogh’s, The Starry Night, but with a twist. Marina Abramovic recreates the famous painting down to a dot, and immerses the user quite literally into the painting. The light dims and perks up depending on the location of the mouse, and the dots are constantly moving. The dots that make up the image fills the screen to look like a real starry night. Moreover, the audio that plays during this immersive session makes the art feel alive in addition to its automatic movements. Some words to describe the sound with the visuals are: sparkly, calming, inspiring, and refreshing. </p>

                <p> No text is shown with the image unless the user clicks on “read more” at the bottom of the screen. This further emphasizes the user’s experience of the work, instead of telling them how to think or feel. Abramovic wanted to create an experience that she feels when looking at Van Gogh’s work in hopes of sharing her feelings with others. Needless to say, her work can make users view <a href = "https://wepresent.wetransfer.com/story/marina-abramovic-traces/"> this piece </a> in a different way from the original thanks to her layers of interactivity.</p>

                <h3> Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h3>
                
                <p> Some things are inevitable to run into on the internet. We may click on a website to find help with our code, or find an article, and bam, pop ups after pop ups. We have grown to ignore a lot of these pop ups, or modals, because of their persistent and sudden appearance, but when designed correctly they can be extremely useful. We may want to use a modal when we want to display information, get user input, or grab the user’s attention. In order for it to be effective, there are several key factors that come into play. </p>

                <p> The modal must have a title to show what the user is looking at, otherwise it’ll be confusing what it’s for. Along the lines of confusion, modals should appear when a user clicks on something. Having a modal appear on its own can be off-putting and ignored if it is not related to a user-initiated action. In the event that the user does want to ignore, or has seen it and wants to get rid of it, the modal should have a visible escape button. It helps to include other ways of escaping by clicking on the shadow or using keys to close the modal. To make use of the shadow, the modal must be an appropriate size that usually allows the original website to be seen underneath it, and the modal appear in the middle of the viewing screen. Being in the center with a dim background helps to bring the attention to the information. A good thing to keep in mind with modals is that less is more. </p>

                <p> Using modals can be reduced to a checklist of questions. Such as: Where and why should it be shown? What should be shown on it? What does the modal look like? And what is the model attempting to convey? This outline helps to create a lean and mean modal.</p>

                <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
                
                <p>The internet is a great way to find information, share things, and consume content. However, if websites have poor UI/UX designs, people will most likely stop using them! The article, “Best Practices for Form Design”, written by Salim Ansari, breaks down the components of a form and how to effectively design them so users will use them.</p>
        
                <p>There are quite a few factors that Ansari covers, many of which are intuitive. These include using appropriate colors with contrast, text size, and formatting inputs to have an inherent flow of logic. Moreover, he touches on the smallest of details that I could easily miss, and will make sure I pay attention to. For example, placeholder text should not be in the input field, but rather below it so that it avoids confusion. That way it doesn’t disappear when the user starts to type, and they don’t have to delete their input to see what the form is looking for. You should also let the user know where they are in filling out a form, as this makes them more likely to complete it. Lastly, but importantly, don’t use a reset button! Users may accidentally click on it instead of the submit button, causing them to be frustrated. If they wanted to reset their input, they can refresh their tab.</p>
        
                <p>Madewell has a nicely formatted checkout page. At the top it shows how many pages you’ll go through, what those pages are for, and where you currently are. Futhermore, the input fields are marked with asterisks to show that they are required. However, these asterisks could be in a different color from the text color so that it is more visible. Here’s a link to “check it out”: <a href = "https://www.madewell.com/shipping "> Madewell</a> </p>
