                <h3> Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</h3>
                
                <p> Some things are inevitable to run into on the internet. We may click on a website to find help with our code, or find an article, and bam, pop ups after pop ups. We have grown to ignore a lot of these pop ups, or modals, because of their persistent and sudden appearance, but when designed correctly they can be extremely useful. We may want to use a modal when we want to display information, get user input, or grab the user’s attention. In order for it to be effective, there are several key factors that come into play. </p>

                <p> The modal must have a title to show what the user is looking at, otherwise it’ll be confusing what it’s for. Along the lines of confusion, modals should appear when a user clicks on something. Having a modal appear on its own can be off-putting and ignored if it is not related to a user-initiated action. In the event that the user does want to ignore, or has seen it and wants to get rid of it, the modal should have a visible escape button. It helps to include other ways of escaping by clicking on the shadow or using keys to close the modal. To make use of the shadow, the modal must be an appropriate size that usually allows the original website to be seen underneath it, and the modal appear in the middle of the viewing screen. Being in the center with a dim background helps to bring the attention to the information. A good thing to keep in mind with modals is that less is more. </p>

                <p> Using modals can be reduced to a checklist of questions. Such as: Where and why should it be shown? What should be shown on it? What does the modal look like? And what is the model attempting to convey? This outline helps to create a lean and mean modal.</p>

                <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
                
                <p>The internet is a great way to find information, share things, and consume content. However, if websites have poor UI/UX designs, people will most likely stop using them! The article, “Best Practices for Form Design”, written by Salim Ansari, breaks down the components of a form and how to effectively design them so users will use them.</p>
        
                <p>There are quite a few factors that Ansari covers, many of which are intuitive. These include using appropriate colors with contrast, text size, and formatting inputs to have an inherent flow of logic. Moreover, he touches on the smallest of details that I could easily miss, and will make sure I pay attention to. For example, placeholder text should not be in the input field, but rather below it so that it avoids confusion. That way it doesn’t disappear when the user starts to type, and they don’t have to delete their input to see what the form is looking for. You should also let the user know where they are in filling out a form, as this makes them more likely to complete it. Lastly, but importantly, don’t use a reset button! Users may accidentally click on it instead of the submit button, causing them to be frustrated. If they wanted to reset their input, they can refresh their tab.</p>
        
                <p>Madewell has a nicely formatted checkout page. At the top it shows how many pages you’ll go through, what those pages are for, and where you currently are. Futhermore, the input fields are marked with asterisks to show that they are required. However, these asterisks could be in a different color from the text color so that it is more visible. Here’s a link to “check it out”: <a href = "https://www.madewell.com/shipping "> Madewell</a> </p>
