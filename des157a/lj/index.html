            <h3>Best Practices for Form Design</h3>
            <date> 18 October, 2021</date>

            <article>
                <p>The internet is a great way to find information, share things, and consume content. However, if websites have poor UI/UX designs, people will most likely stop using them! The article, “Best Practices for Form Design”, written by Salim Ansari, breaks down the components of a form and how to effectively design them so users will use them.</p>
        
                <p>There are quite a few factors that Ansari covers, many of which are intuitive. These include using appropriate colors with contrast, text size, and formatting inputs to have an inherent flow of logic. Moreover, he touches on the smallest of details that I could easily miss, and will make sure I pay attention to. For example, placeholder text should not be in the input field, but rather below it so that it avoids confusion. That way it doesn’t disappear when the user starts to type, and they don’t have to delete their input to see what the form is looking for. You should also let the user know where they are in filling out a form, as this makes them more likely to complete it. Lastly, but importantly, don’t use a reset button! Users may accidentally click on it instead of the submit button, causing them to be frustrated. If they wanted to reset their input, they can refresh their tab.</p>
        
                <p>Madewell has a nicely formatted checkout page. At the top it shows how many pages you’ll go through, what those pages are for, and where you currently are. Futhermore, the input fields are marked with asterisks to show that they are required. However, these asterisks could be in a different color from the text color so that it is more visible. Here’s a link to “check it out”: <a href = "https://www.madewell.com/shipping "> Madewell</a> </p>
