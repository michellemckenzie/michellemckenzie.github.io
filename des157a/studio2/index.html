            <p id = "story1">My boyfriend and I were riding our electric scooters around Davis and I really wanted to go to the sunflower field.

            <div id = "line2"></div>
            <p id = "story2">This was the first time I went kayaking. Carrying the kayak from the car to the lake was exhausting, but worth it. I would only do it during the summer though because water gets in everywhere.</p>

            <p id = "story3">My friends had shown up to my house to surprise me with presents and a cake for my 17th birthday. It meant a lot to me since my birthday is on Christmas and I never get to see friends that day.</p>

            <p id = "story4">Koda is a sweet Australian Shepherd if he knows you have food. Otherwise he’s a rambunctious dog with an infinite amount of energy. You can see my shadow holding a treat up to keep him still long enough to capture his cuteness.</p>

            <p id = "story5">Snapped a photo of my friend Alicia at Lake Tahoe. She woke up early that day to go parasailing with her family. After a cool swim in the crystal water, she’s finally relaxing in the warm sun.</p>

            <p id = "story6">A group of people are lined up on a field. They’re encouraging the other people on the bleachers to join them in a game of soccer.</p>

            <p id = "story7">As a kid, I had a blue Volkswagen Beetle, toy car. It was always my choice for playtime with my younger brother. Now I have a turbo charged Beetle.</p>

            <div id = "line8"></div>
            <p id = "story8">I went on a hike at a place called Cronan Ranch and came across this old looking building. But here’s a surprise, it was built in 2003 for a movie - <i>Love Comes Softly.</i> </p>
