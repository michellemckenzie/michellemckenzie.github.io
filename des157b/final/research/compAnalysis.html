                <p>This website displays user artwork beautifully by having them take up most of the viewport. Moreover, a user's artwork is not cropped so that others can see their whole image at a quick look. Users are also able refine their view/search results by categories to curate a feed that is more personal. This website scrolls smoothly and artwork takes about a second to load into view as more data feeds into the viewport. </p>

                <p>This website captures the essence of what I would like to create - have users customize themselves as a digital selfie. This website lacks the option to choose different skin and eye colors which is what I would like to implement. Moreover, it's difficult to see what the different styling choices are due to how small they appear in their icons. When I choose a different option to use on my character, the entire page will sometimes reload making it somewhat annoying to use.</p>
