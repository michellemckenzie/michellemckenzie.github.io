            <h1>The loneliness of being mixed race in America</h1>
            <h2>The article from Vox was a collection of responses of people who identify as biracial or mixed race, and the responses included information of where they grew up, their environment, how that impacted them, and where they are now. How mixed people perceive themselves can be largely tied to the way they look, and the community that they grow up in. It is insightful to read their responses to see the different ways that a person can identify as, and their reasons for doing so. There are about six personal stories from mixed people of different backgrounds who share their personal story. Using personal narratives in my project would create a more in depth view of mixed people. The authors suggested that a person’s mixed racial identity can be imposed on them by others, or what they may look more like. However in the end, a biracial person’s identity can be fluid and change over time as they learn more about themselves and their communities.</h2>

            <h1>Jen on being half-Korean and half-white</h1>
            <h2>Riad interviews her friend Jen, who is half Korean and half white, about what it is like to be biracial and how she views herself. Jen questions whether she can really even identify as Korean because she can’t speak Korean, does not know much about Korean history, and felt a lot of pressure to somehow know these things, yet she felt so disconnected due to her predominantly white environment. Exploring biracial people who have two families that speak different languages is wildly different to perhaps, a black and white person living in America where both sides may speak English. Jen’s realization that she is not obligated to do anything for just existing as who she is can come as a comfort to others experiencing the same hardships. Biracial people can have varying meanings of what it means to identify as one race or another, and it’s possible to internalize these identity conflicts and project them unto others.</h2>

            <h1>Being Multiracial in America</h1>
            <h2>In the video there are mixed race people recounting their personal experiences in a club called Fusion, which is a place for mixed people to find support. Among these questions, one that sticks out is the future concerning multi-race people, such as where they belong in identity politics and will things change or stay the same for the newer generations. An interesting statistic that was presented was that the 2000 US consesus recorded a little over 7 million people who identified as two or more races, with people who are less than 18 years old making up 41%. Utilizing questions to prompt mixed people about how they feel about their identity can open up conversation in my project. With the group having a large variety of members, most seem to imply the same underlying message; your experiences are ultimately shaped by who your family is. Without a doubt, nurture wins in the case for nature versus nurture, due to how much impact external factors and pressures have on a mixed individual. </h2>
