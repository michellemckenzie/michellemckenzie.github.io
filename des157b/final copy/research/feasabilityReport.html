                <li>Upload your own photo with an optional caption - Back4App</li>
                <li>Delete your photo + caption - Back4App</li>

            <h1>Assessment</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>I have used Google authentication before to have users log into their accounts, so I feel confident to do it again, but I will need to refresh on the small details. I have yet to use Back4App for manual sign up/login authentication but I believe I'll be able to learn it.</li>
                <li>I have not used Masonry Library before, but I have used Grid to display text and images, so I'm hoping it's somewhat similar. If not, the documentation will be enough to learn.</li>
                <li>I have used the Animate On Scroll library and just need to make sure it will work with other libraries.</li>
                <li>I have previously developed mobile and desktop designs and will start off with mobile first.</li>
