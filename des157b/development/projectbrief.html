            <h1>project summary</h1>
            <p>My project will be a collective memory of the accessories and items that extend a person's personality and character. It would ideally be implemented as a responsive interface so that it can be used and viewed across various screen sizes to prompt more user interactions.</p>

            <h1>project goals</h1>
            <p>I would like to create a gallery of images which may represent a part of our lives, interests, and happiness. Posting images to a particular category will allow users to explore similar or different lifestyles. Some categories that may provoke conversation include your favorite pair of shoes, what backpack you use for school, a cuddly pet, and a trusty bike. These aspects may seem small, but can reveal an individual's style, age, gender, interests, ethics, and morals among many characteristics that can be attributed to people. The overall goal is to show a slice of life for our community and to cherish the little things.</p>

            <h1>design strategies</h1>
            <p>An interface that is similar to Instagram, VSCO, or Pinterest would be familiar and easy for users to use. Due to users taking photos in different sizes, displaying photos in the way VSCO and Pinterest displays their content as a scaled version of the shape of the photo would allow a dyanmic photo feed. This unpredicatable flow of photos would have a unique experience compared to the squares of Instagram's interface. Surrounding each photo will be a white border to space them apart. Moreover, having thick white borders on the sides of the interface for desktop view would allow them to be organized and somewhat compact like a photobook. These white borders will not be thick on mobile view to focus on the images.</p>

            <h1>interaction strategies</h1>
            <p>Users will be able to scroll down the page to see photo galleries. If they would like to filter their results, they can click on predefined tags. Users will be able to click on the photo to read a summary if the original poster gave a description. Moreover, users will be able to post their own photo, click which category their photo falls under, and have the option of including a description. I have been thinking about having users create a username and password so that they can delete their photos if they want to, but this would add to the complexity of the project.</p>

        <section>
            <h1>experience goals</h1>
            <p>I want users to be able to express themselves through their belongings and not feel judgement that they may feel posting on different platforms. Their photos capture an extension of themselves and tell a story. My goal from this is to expose people to the different interests of others and experience new or different styles. This could also be a way to highlight small artists or give some spotlight to the very normal parts of life that social media doesn't glamorize.</p>
