            <h1>round 1</h1>
            <p>My alert message asked the user to use the inspection tool to view the website in an iPhone X layout, but Yuting observed the website as is, as picture. This caused the website to look wonky and unproportional. When she uploaded the photos, the form did not clear, causing her to click submit multiple times. When she went back to the collections home page, she did not see her photo (due to not refreshing). When asked if she would submit more than one photo at once, she said that she would not, due to not knowing what all the categories were.</p>

            <img src = "images/round2.jpg">
            <h1>round 2</h1>
            <p>When Urvi went to submit a photo, it took awhile to load, so she kept submitting and refreshing the page. Moreover, when she went to scroll horizontally to view more photos once they loaded, the website revealed the hamburger menu. Urvi expressed that although the submission only allows one photo at once, if it allowed multiple photos to be uploaded together then she would have considered that as a feature, but unless presented she did not think about it.</p>

            <img src = "images/round3.jpg">
            <h1>round 3</h1>
            <p>After Krithika uploaded her photos, and refreshed the page, she ended up having to wait a while for the photos to load, as pictured. Morever, because there was no visual feedback for uploading the photos, she submitted the photos more than once without realizing it. When asked about the layout, she said she would like having all photos collaged together at first, and then the ability to sort by categories when she wanted a more organized view.</p>

            <p class = "updateParagraph">Because I'm working with images, and may need to convert from HEIC/HEIF to JPG, optimize the images, and update the collections homepage with all of the images, there will be some wait times. To make sure that users know that the data is being uploaded, I will use an overlay to disable submissions, and to notify users when they're images are being uploaded and once it has successfully been stored in Back4App. </p>

            <p class = "updateParagraph">
            Moreover, I need to fix the menu to not be visible when a user closes it. It displays when a user scrolls horizontally. Furthermore, I would like each category to be clickable so that it takes up the entire screen, and then users can see more information for each photo such as: the OP's name, a description, and a location.
            </p>

            <p class = "updateParagraph">
            I am also considering having the collections main page show all images together, and then the user can sort them with tags.
